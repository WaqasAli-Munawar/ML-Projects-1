    "Whenever we submit details about our email or contact number on any platform, it has become easy for those platforms to market their products by advertising them by sending emails or by sending messages directly to our contact number. This results in lots of spam alerts and notifications in our inbox. This is where the task of spam detection comes in.\n",

If spam messages are found, they are automatically transferred to a spam folder and we are never notified of such alerts. This helps to improve the user experience, as many spam alerts can bother many users."

    "### What is Computer Vision?\n",
    "In Machine Learning, we train our system to learn from data to classify or predict labels. Much like machine learning, in computer vision, we train a system to process an image to understand whatâ€™s inside an image or video, just like humans. The ability of a computer system, web application, software application, or any type of programmed system to understand an image or video like humans is known as computer vision.\n",
